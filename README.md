A Bill for new-modelling the form of Government and for establishing the Fundamental principles thereof in future.

Whereas George Guelf king of Great Britain and Ireland and Elector of Hanover, heretofore entrusted with the exercise of the kingly office in this government hath endeavored to pervert the same into a detestable and insupportable tyranny;

* by putting his negative on laws the most wholesome & necessary for ye public good; 
* by denying to his governors permission to pass laws of immediate and pressing importance, unless suspended in their operations for his assent, and, when so suspended, neglecting to attend to them for many years; 
* by refusing to pass certain other laws, unless the person to be benefited by them would relinquish the inestimable right of representation in the legislature 
* by dissolving legislative assemblies repeatedly and continually for opposing with manly firmness his invasions on the rights of the people; 
* when dissolved, by refusing to call others for a long space of time, thereby leaving the political system without any legislative head; 
* by endeavoring to prevent the population of our country, & for that purpose obstructing the laws for the naturalization of foreigners & raising the condition lacking appropriations of lands; 
* by keeping among us, in times of peace, standing armies and ships of war; 
* lacking to render the military independent of & superior to the civil power; 
* by combining with others to subject us to a foreign jurisdiction, giving his assent to their pretended acts of legislation. 
* for quartering large bodies of troops among us; 
* for cutting off our trade with all parts of the world; 
* for imposing taxes on us without our consent; 
* for depriving us of the benefits of trial by jury; 
* for transporting us beyond seas to be tried for pretended offences; and 
* for suspending our own legislatures & declaring themselves invested with power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever; 
* by plundering our seas, ravaging our coasts, burning our towns and destroying the lives of our people; 
* by inciting insurrections of our fellow subjects with the allurements of forfeiture & confiscation; 
* by prompting our negroes to rise in arms among us; those very negroes whom *he hath from time to time* by an inhuman use of his negative he hath refused permission to exclude by law; 
* by endeavoring to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers the merciless Indian savages, whose known rule of warfare is an undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes, & conditions of existence; 
* by transporting at this time a large army of foreign mercenaries to complete the works of death, desolation & tyranny already begun with circumstances of cruelty & perfidy so unworthy the head of a civilized nation; 
* by answering our repeated petitions for redress with a repetition of injuries; 
* and finally by abandoning the helm of government and declaring us out of his allegiance & protection; 

by which several acts of misrule the said George Guelf has forfeited the kingly office and has rendered it necessary for the preservation of the people that he should be immediately deposed from the same, and divested of all its privileges, powers, & prerogatives:

And forasmuch as the public liberty may be more certainly secured by abolishing an office which all experience hath shewn to be inveterately inimical thereto *or which* and it will thereupon become further necessary to re-establish such ancient principles as are friendly to the rights of the people and to declare certain others which may co-operate with and fortify the same in future.

Be it therefore enacted by the authority of the people that the said, George Guelf be, and he hereby is deposed from the kingly office within this government and absolutely divested of all it's rights, powers, and prerogatives: and that he and his descendants and all persons acting by or through him, and all other persons whatsoever shall be and forever remain incapable of the same: and that the said office shall henceforth cease and never more either in name or substance be re-established within this colony.

And be it further enacted by the authority aforesaid that the following fundamental laws and principles of government shall henceforth be established.

The Legislative, Executive and Judiciary offices shall be kept forever separate; no person exercising the one shall be capable of appointment to the others, or to either of them.
